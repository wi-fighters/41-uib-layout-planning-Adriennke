                Some of the best shit ever. I'm pretty much addicted to Churches song literally! The best thing is that
                this
                is not the most crowded artist list we've ever done. Remember back in the beginning when we first did
                this?
                How many opinions did we get on that first-ever poll? Well at the time, it was 32 things. They were
                submitted by the all of you, the people. That sounds like such a boring answer, but it still speaks to
                just
                how awesome the poll was back then..
